# Praktikum zur Simulation von autonomen Fahrzeugen - Gruppe 2
Author: Valentin HÃ¶pfner

The goal of this project was to develop an autonomous vehicle for the CARLA-simulator. The agent is to move collision-free and autonomously on various maps, on which other vehicles are also traveling, from an arbitrary starting point to an arbitrary destination. Two different modes are relevant for the evaluation: one mode in which traffic rules are observed, and one mode in which they are not. 

## Overview over the packages
We developed various ROS-nodes for the core-functionalities of our ego-vehicle. Each ROS-node is wrapped in a package, and those packages can be further grouped into one of three categories: Perception, Planning and Acting. An overview over the packages and some of their interfaces is provided in the following graphic.

Another (somewhat less readable) way to visualize the nodes and their communication - with each other and with the ros-bridge - is a rosgraph:

## [Acting](Acting)

### [ego_vehicle](Acting/ego_vehicle)
This node is used to launch the ros bridge and all the other packages. It also contains the config.json file, that describes the sensor-array.

### [steering_controllers](Acting/steering_controllers)
This node computes a [CarlaEgoVehicleControl-Message](https://github.com/carla-simulator/ros-carla-msgs/blob/master/msg/CarlaEgoVehicleControl.msg) in each time step and publishes it to the ros-bridge. It uses a Stanley-Controller to follow the local path that is published by the local planner. The throttle command is computed through two PID-Controllers, one for distance and one for speed. This provides a primitive [ACC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_cruise_control) that is also used to avoid collisions. 

## [Planning](Planning)

### [global_planner](Planning/global_planner)
This node computes a global path from the position of the ego_vehicle to a given finish position. 

### [local_planner](Planning/local_planner)
This node provides a service, that can be called on to compute a local path. You can pass parameters to switch lanes or get into the right lane for turning on an intersection.

### [behaviour_agent](Planning/behaviour_agent)
This node contains the behaviour agent, that decides on the ego_vehicles actions (i.e. switching lane, overtaking) based on data from the Perception-nodes. It is based on a behaviour tree. It can influence the vehicles actions, by calling the local_planner to compute new paths, or passing a different target-speed to the steering_controllers node. 

## [Perception](Perception)

### [commonroad_map_provider](Perception/commonroad_map_provider)
This node parses the OpenDrive-File and provides it in the right format to the local- and global-planners.

### [radar](Perception/radar)
This node computes the distance to the car driving in front. Also considers the local path to filter the radar data. 

### [road_features](Perception/road_features)
This node computes informations about the current lanelet, like distance to the next intersection or the number of lanes. This information is provided to the behaviour agent.
