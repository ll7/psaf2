## About
This node uses the Radar-Sensor to compute to the car driving in front. This information is then passed to the longitudinal controller inside the [steering_controllers-Package](https://github.com/ll7/psaf2/tree/main/Acting/steering_controllers) via the `/psaf/ego_vehicle/radar/distance`-Topic. It also provides the information if there is any car in front to the [Behaviour-Node](https://github.com/ll7/psaf2/tree/main/Planning/behavior_agent) via a topic. 

To compute the distance all points provided by the Radar-Sensor are first filtered according to their distance to the local-Path. We achieve decent Perception results in Turns and Intersection this way. From the filtered Point-Cloud we select whichever point is closest to the Ego-Vehicle (by Euclidean Distance) and return that distance.
